# **🔐 Password Tool - Web-Based Cybersecurity Educational Application**
## **📌 Overview**
The purpose of our application is to educate users about password strength and encourage the use of good cybersecurity practices. Users will be able to input any password, and the system calculates the time it would take to crack the password using various attack methods. The system will perform a series of algorithms based on attack parameters, providing the user with immediate results of the simulated attack.

## **🎯 Features**
- **Attack Menu** — Customize attacker type and hardware (e.g., gaming PC, botnet).
- **Password Strength Analysis** — Estimates crack time using brute force, dictionary, and hybrid attacks.
- **Educational Feedback** — Explains why a password is weak/strong.
- **Recommendations** — Offers tips for stronger, more resilient passwords.
### **Potential Features**
- Live cyber attack map visualization
- Password game with progressive difficulty
- Browser extension to show crack-time metrics in real time
